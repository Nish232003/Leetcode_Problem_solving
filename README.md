# LeetCode Problem Solving 🚀

This repository documents my Data Structures & Algorithms journey through LeetCode.
It contains clean, optimized solutions along with consistent problem-solving practice.

## 📌 Goals

* Strengthen DSA fundamentals
* Improve pattern recognition
* Write readable and optimized code
* Maintain consistency in daily problem solving

## 💻 Tech Stack

* Language: Python
* Platform: LeetCode

## 📈 Approach

For each problem:

1. Understand the problem statement
2. Identify pattern (Hashing, Two Pointer, Sliding Window, etc.)
3. Write optimized solution
4. Keep code clean and readable
5. Push consistently to track progress

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository helps me:

* Track my preparation for coding interviews
* Build strong problem-solving skills
* Maintain a public record of my learning journey

## 🔄 Future Plans

* Add time & space complexity for each solution
* Add multiple approaches (brute force → optimized)
* Organize problems by topic
* Maintain daily consistency
